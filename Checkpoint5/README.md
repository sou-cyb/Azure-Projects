### Part A - Containerize an application
- **Question1:** 
Why the build time will be different from first time?

üê≥ The build time for the command `docker build -t getting-started .` can differ when executed again due to docker's layer-based architecture. Each instruction in the `Dockerfile` creates a separate layer. If the image is rebuilt without modifying the instructions, `Docker` can reuse the existing layers from the previous build. 

Why the number of steps are also different?

üê≥ When rebuilding the image without any changes, `Docker` optimizes the process by reusing the previously built layers. As a result, the number of steps executed is reduced, This optimization speeds up the process, resulting in a faster build time during subsequent image creation.

- **Question2:**
What does `-t ` flag do? 

üê≥ The `-t` Stands for "tag" and is used to assign a tag, because when you are building `Docker image`, which provides a unique tag to identify the image that we are creating. However, not using `-t` while creating an image without specefiying the tag the `Docker` will indicate it missing. Here is an example of the error message

```bash
$ docker build getting-started .

ERROR: "docker buildx build" requires exactly 1 argument.
See 'docker buildx build --help'.

Usage:  docker buildx build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -     

Start a build
```

- **Question3:**
why still one image listed even we ran the command multiple time?

üê≥ Even if we run the command `docker build -t getting-started .` multiple times it still shows only one image listed when running `docker image ls`. This tells us that when building a `Docker Image`, each instruction in the `Dockerfile` creates a new layer. However, `Docker` optimizes the build process by caching intermediate layers that have not changed because we were building image without modifying the instructionsin `Dockefile`.

- **Question4:**
What are the `-d` and `-p` flags?

üê≥ The `-d` stands for "detached" mode, which it runs the `Container` in the background and returns the command immediately and allowing to use the terminal for other tasks, However, in this task I have noticed that the `Container` was runing in `Ducker desktop` while i was not able to use the terminal.

üê≥ The `-p` flag serves the purpose of specifying port mapping, enabling the establishment of a connection between the ports of a `Container` and those on the host machine. This functionality empowers you to create and configure the necessary communication channels between the `Container` and the host environment, facilitating seamless interaction between the two entities.
 
```bash
$ docker run -p 1000:3000 getting-started

Using sqlite database at /etc/todos/todo.db
Listening on port 3000
...
````

- **Question5:**
Which port in `localhost` must be used to reach it?

üê≥ The `Port 1000` is set for accessing the `Container` on `localhost`, because this port has been specifically mapped to the `Container`, which is a direct pathway for communication port. However, the data transmitted to `Port 1000` on the host machine is redirected to the port of the `Container`

- **Question6:** 
What the difference between the `Containers` listed?

üê≥ The following `Containers` have been created and mapping to different `Ports` and allow the `Containers` to be accessed using different ports:
- The first `Container` is mapped from the `Port 1000` of the host machine to `Port 3000` of the `Container`
- The second `Container` is mapped from the `Port 3000` of the host machine to `Port 3000` of the `Container`

```bash
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE             COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
851b72a88bf3   getting-started   "docker-entrypoint.s‚Ä¶"   2 minutes ago    Up 2 minutes    0.0.0.0:1000->3000/tcp   eloquent_lehmann
5ca4bee41f9c   getting-started   "docker-entrypoint.s‚Ä¶"   50 minutes ago   Up 50 minutes   0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp   magical_dubinsky
```

- **Question7:**
How long did it take to create the image after you updated the code?

üê≥ Creating the image after updating the code will depend on various factors such as the complexity of the changes, the performance of the `host machine`, and the size of the image. However, the speed of building an image will vary when reusing the existing layers but will not be too long than the initial build.

- **Question8:**
What is the error message you get when you try to run the app container?

üê≥ After runing the command `docker run -dp 3000:3000 getting-started` which is attempting an error. However, the error message indicates that the port 3000 is already in use by another `Container` on the host machine.

```bash
$ docker run -dp 3000:3000 getting-started

d764f5f53c7bde09e1c9290be70c948e4eba266c0e14b0aa7c8568857fb00868
